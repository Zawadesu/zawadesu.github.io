My name is Oren Min, an undergraduate at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/) majoring in biology science, and I stayed in the Bioengineering department at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) for half a year. I'm now doing research at [Omics Lab](http://omicslab.genetics.ac.cn/) under Prof. Xiujie Wang's instruction in the [Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology](https://genetics.cas.cn/).

“What is life?” Schrödinger once asked, and I’ve been always asking myself this easy but hard-to-answer question to capture something orderly in the pace life runs with the increase of entropy. I’m interested in exploring the molecular mechanism of interaction between proteins and nucleic acids or protein and protein, and I'm now making efforts to explore the feasibility of the *in silico* cell. 

The more one knows, the more one knows he doesn't know.
